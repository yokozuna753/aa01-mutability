/*
Write a function doubleSequence that accepts a base and a length as
arguments. The function should return an array representing a sequence that
contains "length" elements. The first element of the sequence is always the
"base", the subsequent elements can be generated by doubling the previous
element of the sequence.
*/

/*
    1.function takes in a base number and a length
    2.the base number is the start of the sequence
    3.the end result should contain a total of "length" elements
    4. the elements after the first are obtained by doubling the first element
    - insert the base element into an empty array
    - insert "length" elements into the array after the "base" index

    input: 2,3
    output: 2, 4, 8
